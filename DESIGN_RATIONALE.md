# Tixo Design Rationale

To ensure **Tixo** stands out as a unique product and avoids copyright/trademark infringement of existing major platforms (Instagram, Twitter, Telegram), the following design choices were implemented:

## 1. Reels (Clips) vs Instagram Reels/TikTok
*   **Control Placement**: Tixo places interaction controls (Like, Share, Comments) in a horizontal floating bar at the **bottom-center** of the screen, unlike the industry standard vertical stack on the right edge. This improves ergonomics for thumb reach on larger phones.
*   **Metadata**: User info and captions are contained in a **floating glass-morphism card** at the top-left, rather than overlaying the bottom of the video. This separates content info from interaction controls.
*   **Visuals**: Use of a "Neon Mint" accent color and distinct rounded iconography prevents visual confusion with Instagram's pink/purple gradient or TikTok's red/blue split.

## 2. Feed vs Twitter/X
*   **Avatar Alignment**: Tixo uses a card layout where the avatar is distinct or integrated into the header row with prominent verification badges, rather than the strict left-column avatar layout of Twitter.
*   **Reposts**: Reposted content is rendered in a "nested card" style with a distinct background shade, emphasizing the curatorial aspect rather than just pushing content.
*   **Typography**: Tixo uses the `Outfit` display font for headers and branding to give a geometric, modern feel distinct from standard system sans-serifs.

## 3. Messaging vs Telegram/WhatsApp
*   **AI Integration**: The AI Bot is not just another user; it has a dedicated "System Card" styling (border, glow) to clearly distinguish synthetic text from human text.
*   **Channel UI**: Channels use distinct square avatars and specific iconography to differentiate from personal chats at a glance.

## 4. Branding
*   **Name**: Tixo is a unique, short, non-descriptive name.
*   **Palette**: `Dark Mode (#0a0a0a)` + `Neon Mint (#00ff9d)` creates a cyber-minimalist aesthetic not currently used by the "Big 3" social apps.
